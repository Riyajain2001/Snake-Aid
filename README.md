# Snake-Aid
My project is to identify
and save snakes maintaining a balance in the food web. Whenever anyone
encounters a snake then - "SnakeAid" will be the solution to it. The
user will be allowed to take a photo of the snake and our app will give them
all information related to the snake and identify whether it is venomous or
non-venomous.
